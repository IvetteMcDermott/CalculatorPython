    Extend the limit of parameters (numbers) it can process.
    Use of string to storage the process.
    Refactor the operators code.


## CREDITS:

    For this app I had been inspired by Python communities in Facebook, where seen others people results and some snippets, what give me idea of what library read into. Also seen the Codemy tutorial on it. Finally video on the use of Pyinstaller and its documentation.
